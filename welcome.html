            <h2>Introduction to VR</h2>
            <p>Virtual Reality (VR) is a simulated experience that can be similar to or completely different from the real world. 
            It involves a user interacting with a computer-generated environment through various devices such as headsets, gloves, and body suits.        
            Virtual Reality – Introduction
Imagination is to Technology as Fuel is to Fire. Imagination and purpose together drive technology. It is due to these that technology today is evolving at an exponential rate. Virtual Reality on one hand places the viewer inside a moment or a place, made possible by visual and sound technology that maneuvers the brain into believing it is somewhere else. 
It is an experience of a world that does not exist. Sounds cool, right?! 
            
              Virtual Reality tricks one’s mind using computers that allow one to experience and more interestingly, interact with a 3D world. 
              This is made possible by putting on a head-mounted display that sends a form of input tracking. 
              The display is split between the eyes and thus creates a stereoscopic 3D effect with stereo sound to give you a graphic experience. 
              The technology feeds in the images of the objects taken at slightly different angles which creates an impression of depth and solidity. 
              The LCD or OLED panels inside are refracted by lenses completely fill the field of vision with what is to be displayed and experienced.

              Together with the technology and the input tracking, it creates an immersive and exciting believable world that the computer generates. What we know today as VR, has been existing for decades now. 
              
              Taking you back to when 360° paintings took the world by surprise, giving a virtual element.
              VR merely is ‘The Wise Guy’ of the digital world. It creates a world that neither functions according to you, nor does it respond to your actions. It gives you a first-hand experience with even the after-effects of an event along with the ability to interacta and interrelate with the world created. 
              This technology holds vast potential insights into the workings of the Human Brain. According to researchers and medical specialists, VRs have the ability to diagnose medical conditions from social anxiety to chronic pain.
              Though the use of VR to tweak the brain is still at a budding stage.

              While most people were too engrossed in its advancements and leap in gaming and exploring the industry, many are unaware of its achievements in the health sector. VRs have been successfully treating post-traumatic stress disorder since the 1990s, the new programs thus address a much broader range of conditions. 
              The VR content exposes the patients to a virtual, safe, and controlled environment where they can explore and eventually learn that the threats they are worried about can be tackled patiently with time, thinking, and analyzing. VR displays are available in various forms. Ranging from the ones that already contain the display, splitting the feed for each eye using a cable to transfer the feed to the console,tomore affordable ones which depend upon the VR mode and applications on Smartphones.
                
The HTC Vive, the Oculus Rift, and Sony PlayStation VR are a few of the head mounts that use this setup. One can create one’s own Virtual Reality Box at home, along with a smartphone compatible with the VR mode. Irrespective of the use, Virtual Reality produces a set of data that can be used to develop models, communication, training methods, and interaction. In simple words, the possibilities are endless.</p>

            <h2>History of VR</h2>
            <p>The concept of VR has been around since the 1950s, but it wasn't until the late 20th century that technology caught up with imagination, leading to the development of VR as we know it today. Milestones include the creation of the first head-mounted display (HMD) and the rise of consumer VR platforms.
            In 1935 Stanley Weinbaum released Pygmalion’s Spectacles – a science fiction story. The story’s main character wears a pair of goggles which transports him to a fictional world which stimulates his senses aptly and features holographic recordings. Some consider it to be the origin of the virtual reality (VR) concept as this story was a good prediction of the aims and achievements of the future.

However the first VR technical developments were in the 1830s, so this is where our timeline starts:

1838
Sir Charles Wheatstone was the first to describe stereopsis in 1838 and was awarded the Royal Medal of the Royal Society in 1840 for his explanation of binocular vision, a research which led him to construct the stereoscope.

The research demonstrated that the brain combines two photographs (one eye viewing each) of the same object taken from different points to make the image appear to have a sense of depth and immersion (3-dimensional).

This technology enabled Wheatstone to create the earliest type of stereoscope. It used a pair of mirrors at 45 degree angles to the user’s eyes, each reflecting a picture located off to the side.

1935
In 1935 American science fiction writer Stanley Weinbaum presented a fictional model for VR in his short story Pygmalion’s Spectacles. In the story, the main character meets a professor who invented a pair of goggles which enabled “a movie that gives one sight and sound […] taste, smell, and touch. […] You are in the story, you speak to the shadows (characters) and they reply […] the story is all about you, and you are in it.”

Pygmalion's Spectacles

1956
Cinematographer Morton Heilig created Sensorama, the first VR machine (patented in 1962). It was a large booth that could fit up to four people at a time. It combined multiple technologies to stimulate all of the senses: there was a combined full colour 3D video, audio, vibrations, smell and atmospheric effects, such as wind.

This was done using scent producers, a vibrating chair, stereo speakers and a stereoscopic 3D screen. Heilig thought that the Sensorama was the “cinema of the future” and he wanted to fully immerse people in their films. Six short films were developed for it.

1960
Heilig also patented the Telesphere Mask which was the first head-mounted display (HMD). This provided stereoscopic 3D images with wide vision and stereo sound. There was no motion tracking in the headset at this point.

1961
Until Headsight was created by Comeau and Bryan, two Philco Corporation engineers. Headsight was the first motion tracking HMD. It had built-in video screens for each eye and a head-tracking system.

However, this wasn’t used for virtual reality; it was developed for the military to allow them to remotely look at hazardous situations. A remote camera imitated the head movements so the user could look around the setting.

1965
Ivan Sutherland, a computer scientist, presented his vision of the Ultimate Display. The concept was of a virtual world viewed through an HMD which replicated reality so well that the user would not be able to differentiate from actual reality. This included the user being able to interact with objects. This concept featured computer hardware to form the virtual world and to keep it functioning in real-time. His paper is seen as the fundamental blueprint for VR.

“The ultimate display would, of course, be a room within which the computer can control the existence of matter. A chair displayed in such a room would be good enough to sit in. Handcuffs displayed in such a room would be confining, and a bullet displayed in such a room would be fatal. With appropriate programming such a display could literally be the Wonderland into which Alice walked.”

1966
Thomas Furness, a military engineer, created the first flight simulator for the Air Force. This assisted in the progression of VR because the military subsequently provided a lot of funding for producing better flight simulators.

1968
Sutherland, with his student Bob Sproull, created the first virtual reality HMD, named The Sword of Damocles. This head-mount connected to a computer rather than a camera and was quite primitive as it could only show simple virtual wire-frame shapes.

These 3D models changed perspective when the user moved their head due to the tracking system. It was never developed beyond a lab project because it was too heavy for users to comfortably wear; they had to be strapped in because it was suspended from the ceiling.

1969
Myron Krueger, a computer artist, developed a succession of “artificial reality” experiences using computers and video systems. He created computer-generated environments that responded to the people in it. These projects led to VIDEOPLACE technology which is mentioned later.

1972
General Electric Corporation built a computerised flight simulator which featured a 180-degree field of vision by using three screens surrounding the cockpit.

1975
Krueger’s VIDEOPLACE, the first interactive VR platform, was displayed at the Milwaukee Art Center. It used computer graphics, projectors, video cameras, video displays and position-sensing technology and it didn’t use goggles or gloves. VIDEOPLACE consisted of dark rooms with large video screens to surround the user in “VR”.

VIDEOPLACE VR platform
The users could see their computer-generated silhouettes imitating their own movements and actions – the users’ movements were recorded on camera and transferred onto the silhouette. Also, users in different rooms could interact with other users’ silhouettes in the same virtual world. This encouraged the idea that people could communicate within a virtual world even if they weren’t physically close.

1977
Aspen Movie Map was created by MIT. This program enabled users to virtually wander through Aspen city in Colorado, like with Google Street View. There were three modes: summer, winter and polygons.

It was created using photographs from a car driving through the city. There were no HMDs but it was the use of first-person interactivity and it suggested that VR could transport people to other places.

1979
McDonnell-Douglas Corporation integrated VR into its HMD, the VITAL helmet, for military use. A head tracker in the HMD followed the pilot’s eye movements to match computer-generated images.

1980
StereoGraphics company created stereo vision glasses.

1982
Sayre gloves were created by Sandin and Defanti. These gloves were the first wired gloves. They monitored hand movements by using light emitters and photocells in the gloves’ fingers. So, when the user moved their fingers the amount of light hitting the photocell varied which then converted the finger movements into electrical signals. This may have been the beginning of gesture recognition.

Furness created a working model of a virtual flight simulator, for the military, called the Visually Coupled Airborne Systems Simulator (VCASS).

1985
Jaron Lanier and Thomas Zimmerman founded VPL Research, Inc. This company is known as the first company to sell VR goggles and gloves. They developed a range of VR equipment, such as, the DataGlove, EyePhone HMD and the Audio Sphere.

VPL Research developed a range of VR equipment.

1986
Furness developed a flight simulator between 1986-1989 known as the Super Cockpit. The training cockpit featured: computer-generated 3D maps, advanced infrared and radar imagery and the pilot could see and hear in real-time.

The helmet’s tracking system and sensors allowed the pilot to control the aircraft using gestures, speech and eye movements. Read more about Thomas Furness.

1987
British Aerospace used the HMD similarly to Furness’ Super Cockpit and developed the Virtual Cockpit which also featured speech recognition.

Jaron Lanier popularised the term “Virtual Reality” while at VPL Research. The VR and graphics-related patents were later bought by Sun Microsystems.

The company Dimension International created a software that could build 3D worlds in a PC.

1989
Scott Foster founded Crystal River Engineering Inc after receiving a contract from NASA to develop the audio element of the Virtual Environment Workstation Project (VIEW) – a VR training simulator for astronauts. Through this company real-time binaural 3D audio processing was developed.

Virtual environment workstation project NASA
Mattel, Inc released the Power Glove, based on VPL’s DataGlove. The Power Glove was a controller accessory for the Nintendo Entertainment System, but it never took off as it was difficult to use.

1990
Jonathan Waldern exhibited Virtuality, a VR arcade machine, at the Computer Graphics 90 exhibition in London.

1991
Antonio Medina, a NASA scientist, designed a VR system to drive the Mars robot rovers from Earth in supposed real-time despite signal delays between the planets. This system is called “Computer Simulated Teleoperation”.

The Virtuality Group launched Virtuality. These were VR arcade machines where gamers could play in a 3D gaming world. This was the first mass-produced VR entertainment system.

A Virtuality pod featured VR headsets and real-time immersive stereoscopic 3D images. Some of the machines could be networked together for multi-player games. Eventually some of the very popular arcade games, like Pac-Man, had VR versions.

SEGA announced that they were working on the SEGA VR headset which would be available for the general public to purchase. This headset was meant to be used for arcade games and the Mega Drive console. It had a visor-like look due to the influence of popular films, such as, RoboCop. LCD displays were placed in the visor, as well as stereo headphones and sensors for tracking head movement.

However, it was never released even though four games were made for it. One of the explanations for the termination was SEGA’s concern of people injuring themselves as the VR effect was too realistic. However, this seems unlikely due to the limited processing power.

1994
SEGA released SEGA VR-1, a motion simulator arcade machine.

VictorMaxx released a VR headset called CyberMaxx.

1995
Nintendo launched the Virtual Boy console which played 3D monochrome video games. It was the first portable console to display 3D graphics. But it was a commercial failure due to:

The lack of colour graphics
The lack of software support
It wasn’t comfortable to use
One year later it was discontinued.

Affordable home VR headsets were released:

Virtual IO released the I-Glasses.
VFX1 Headgear was released by Forte.
1997
Georgia Tech and Emory University researchers used VR to create war zone scenarios for veterans receiving exposure therapy for PTSD. This was known-as Virtual Vietnam [link 1][link 2].

2001
SAS Cube was the first PC based cubic room. It led to Virtools VR Pack.

2007
Google introduced Street View.

Immersive Media was identified as the contractor that captured the imagery for four of the five cities initially mapped by Street View, using its patented dodecahedral camera array on a moving car.

2010
Google introduced a stereoscopic 3D mode for Street View.

Palmer Luckey, an 18-year-old entrepreneur, created the first prototype of the Oculus Rift headset. It featured a 90-degree field of vision, which had never been seen before, and relied on a computer’s processing power to deliver the images. This new development boosted and refreshed interest in VR.

2012
Luckey launched a Kickstarter campaign for the Oculus Rift which raised $2.4 million.

2014
Facebook bought the Oculus VR company for $2 billion. This was a defining moment in VR’s history because VR gained momentum rapidly after this.

Sony announced that they were working on Project Morpheus, a VR headset for the PlayStation 4 (PS4).

Google released the Cardboard – a low-cost and do-it-yourself stereoscopic viewer for smartphones.

Samsung announced the Samsung Gear VR, a headset that uses a Samsung Galaxy smartphone as a viewer.

More people started exploring the possibilities of VR, including adding innovative accessories, for example Cratesmith, an independent developer, recreated a hoverboard scene from Back to the Future by pairing the Oculus Rift with a Wii’s balance board.

2015
VR possibilities started becoming widely available to the general public, for example:

The Wall Street Journal launched a VR roller coaster that followed the ups and downs of the Nasdaq Stock Market.
The BBC created a 360-degree video where users view a Syrian migrant camp.
The Washington Post released a VR experience of the Oval Office at the White House Correspondents’ Association Dinner.
RYOT, a media company, exhibited Confinement, a short VR film about solitary confinement in US prisons.
Etc.
Gloveone was successful in its Kickstarter campaign. These gloves let users feel and interact with virtual objects.

2016
By 2016 hundreds of companies were developing VR products.

Most of the headsets had dynamic binaural audio.

Haptic interfaces were underdeveloped. Haptic interfaces are systems that allow humans to interact with a computer using their touch and movements – like the Gloveone gloves that were being developed. This meant that handsets were typically button-operated.

HTC released its HTC VIVE SteamVR headset. This was the first commercial release of a headset with sensor-based tracking which allowed users to move freely in a space.

HTC Vive released in 2016
2017
Many companies are developing their own VR headsets, including HTC, Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft Sony, Samsung etc.

Sony may be developing a similar location tracking tech to HTC’s VIVE for the PlayStation 4.

2018
At Facebook F8, Oculus demonstrated a new headset prototype, the Half Dome. This is a varifocal headset with a 140 degrees field of vision.

Virtual reality has significantly progressed and is now being used in a variety of ways, from providing immersive gaming experiences, to helping treat psychological disorders, to teaching new skills and even taking terminally ill people on virtual journeys. VR has many applications and with the rise in smartphone technology VR will be even more accessible.

2019
Forbes describes this as The Year Virtual Reality Gets Real. Oculus Quest, Facebook’s standalone headset, created a lot of interest and momentum, selling out in many locations and generating $5 million worth of content sales.

The shift from tethered to standalone VR headsets represented a shift within the immersive ecosystem, as standalone headsets are much easier to use for the average consumer.

Road to VR reported that the monthly-connected VR headsets on Steam had surpassed 1 million for the first time.

Nintendo entered the VR market with the Labo: VR kit for Nintendo Switch on April 12.

In March, Beat Saber became the first application to sell over 1 million copies in under a year.

2020
The Oculus Quest 2 was unveiled on September 16, 2020, during the Facebook Connect 7 event.

The Quest 2 received mostly positive reviews as an incremental update to the Quest and continues to sell in the millions around the world.

2021
Pico launches the Pico Neo 3 headset, a competitor to the Oculus Quest 2 headset.

The Chinese company ByteDance, which owns TikTok, acquired Pico in a push to diversify its business.

Facebook (now Meta) plans to spend at least $10 billion this year on Facebook Reality Labs, its metaverse division tasked with creating AR and VR hardware, software, and content.

2023
Apple announced its entry into the VR market with the Apple Vision Pro, an upcoming mixed-reality headset announced on June 5, 2023, at its 2023 Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). The headset will sell for $3,499.

Meta announced the Meta Quest 3 on June 1, 2023, and it was launched on October 10. The Meta Quest 3 is a mixed-reality headset featuring significant advancements in display quality, processing power, and tracking capabilities. It boasts a resolution of 2160 x 2160 per eye (compared to 1832 x 1920 in the Quest 2), the Snapdragon XR2+ processor, and inside-out tracking with improved accuracy and field of view. The headset is available for $499.


2024
On February 2nd, 2024, the highly anticipated Apple Vision Pro arrived in the hands of eager early adopters in the US. The release generated significant excitement, with the internet flooded with videos and testimonials showcasing the device in various settings. While some saw it as a potential catalyst for mainstream VR adoption, others raised concerns about its accessibility and content ecosystem.</p>

            <h2>How VR Works</h2>
            <p>VR works by tracking the user's motions and adjusting the virtual environment accordingly in real-time. This immersive experience is achieved through the use of VR headsets that display 3D images, along with sensors and external cameras for motion tracking.
            How does Virtual Reality work?
Virtual Reality (VR) works by simulating a realistic 3D environment through a combination of hardware and software.

The functioning of VR technology
The basis of VR technology is an end-to-end mechanism that replaces the natural environment with a deceptively real-looking simulation.

This simulation is strongly oriented to the real world. In order to adapt the digital world to the real world as best as possible, modern AI algorithms are usually used. These have the task of projecting new and familiar elements onto a mathematically defined surface. The result is a virtual world that looks deceptively real to users.

The hardware typically includes a headset or display, motion controllers, and sensors that track the user’s movements and gestures in real-time. The software involves creating a digital environment using computer-generated graphics, audio, and other sensory inputs to simulate a fully immersive experience.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="page4">
            <h2>Types of VR Systems</h2>
            <p>There are mainly two types of VR systems: tethered and standalone. Tethered systems require a connection to a powerful computer, while standalone systems are self-contained and offer more freedom of movement.
                Standalone VR glasses are glasses that work without being connected to a Computer. This makes the VR glasses very easy to use, because they are not attached with with a cable to the PC.
        
Among tons of VR formats, these are the 5 most influential ones:

Non-immersive Virtual Reality.
Fully Immersive Virtual Reality.
Semi-Immersive Virtual Reality.
Augmented Reality.
Collaborative VR.
Now let’s learn more about each of these types of VR formats:
                
1. Non-immersive Virtual Reality
Non-immersive virtual reality refers to a virtual experience through a computer where you can control some characters or activities within the software, but the environment is not directly interacting with you.

In addition to desktop computers, you can also find a robust laptop for virtual machines and work on the go. Since more and more people appreciate mobility, manufacturers create powerful systems in compact bodies.

For example, when you play video games such as World of WarCraft, you can control characters within the game that have their own animations and attributes.

(Interestingly, over the years, several science conferences have been held within the World of Warcraft ‘world’. Utilizing the platform instead of a traditional web conferencing system while creating an innovative experience for members. This, of course, has its own benefits compared to traditional means.)

Technically, you are dealing with a virtual world, but you are not the center of attention in the game.

All actions or features are rather interacting with the characters within.

Non-immersive VR
So basically, all basic forms of gaming devices, such as PlayStation, Xbox, Computer, etc, provide you with a non-immersive virtual reality experience.

However, the US Defence Force suggested that strategic games may help to develop the planning and strategic expertise of the US Army back in 2017.

This has been put in effective use since Summer 2018.

2. Fully Immersive Virtual Reality
On contrary to non-immersive virtual reality, a fully immersive virtual technology ensures that you have a realistic experience within the virtual world.

It’ll give you a sense of being present in that virtual world, and everything is happening to you for real.

This is an expensive form of virtual reality that involves helmets, gloves, and body connectors with sense detectors.

These are connected to a powerful computer. Your movements, reactions, and even a blink of an eye are detected and projected within the virtual world.

You will feel like you are within the virtual world physically.

One example could be a Virtual Shooter gaming zone where you will be equipped with the gears in a small room and you will be viewing a virtual world through the helmet where you are facing other shooters trying to kill you.

You will move your arms and body to run, jump, crouch, shoot, throw, and many more within the game.

A new concept of virtual medical training is being looked at to train neurosurgeons to avoid disasters during risky brain operations.

Many more such concepts are coming to life and hopefully will result in making our lives better.

A fully immersive virtual reality is costly and not so widely created yet.

3. Semi-Immersive Virtual Reality
A semi-immersive virtual reality is a mixture of non-immersive and fully immersive virtual reality.

This can be in the form of a 3D space or virtual environment where you can move about on your own, either through a computer screen or a VR box/headset.

So all activities within the virtual world are concentrated toward you.

However, you have no real physical movements other than your visual experience.

On a computer, you can use the mouse to move about the virtual space, and on mobile devices, you can touch and swipe to move about the place.

Semi-immersive VR
Most semi-immersive virtual environments support Gyroscope, which means the virtual space will be fixed on your phone based on the vertical axis, and you have to literally move your phone about in different directions to view the virtual environment in those directions.

Swiping will not work.

The ones that are connected to VR boxes are more interactive since they are also a form of Gyroscope, but without you using your hands.

When you wear a VR box/headset, you will only be able to see the virtual environment and not your real world, even from the corner of your eye. Thus creating a realistic experience.

Semi-immersive virtual reality is the most cost-effective and commonly used among all forms of virtual reality after non-immersive VR.

A virtual tour is the most popular semi-immersive virtual reality that most businesses are embracing today.

They can be both device-based and web-based. Overall, they provide an interactive virtual experience.

It is mostly used in businesses such as real estate websites, hotels, local bars or pubs, universities, schools, and many more businesses that rely on highlighting and promoting their locations.

4. Augmented Reality
Augmented Reality is when a certain entity or device seems to be present in reality but is actually not.

Rather than putting you into a virtual world, a virtual entity is placed in the real world through any device.

For example, through your mobile screen, you can view your room, and probably place a cartoon character in the corner. You will be able to see the character through your mobile screen and not in reality.

It is mostly used by businesses such as furniture suppliers or decorators.

For example, a person willing to buy a table will be able to place the table in his room through his phone display.

This will let him understand if this table is suitable and looks good in his room or if he has to choose another design.

Augmented reality often is argued to be a unique form of technology rather than VR. There are also a few technology consulting services that often assist in implementing augmented reality solutions effectively.

But its ability to place entities virtually often puts it within the VR category.

5. Collaborative VR
This is a form of a virtual world where different people from various locations can come into contact within a virtual environment, usually in the form of 3D or projected characters.

Collaborative VR
For example, Unity game development has also embraced the concept of virtual collaboration, much like the video game called PUBG (Players Unknown Battle-Ground), where tons of players come into existence as individual virtual characters that they can control. Similarly, the integration of hybrid casual elements in virtual reality games is becoming increasingly popular, offering a unique blend of simplicity and engagement.

Much like the transformative impact of igaming development in its sector, VR technologies are paving the way for innovative experiences across various domains.

            <h2>Applications of VR</h2>
            <p>VR has a wide range of applications including gaming, education, healthcare, military training, and virtual meetings. Its ability to create immersive, interactive environments makes it a powerful tool for learning, entertainment, and communication.
                virtualspeech-logo

1. Automotive industry
VR allows engineers and designers to experiment easily with the look and build of a vehicle before commissioning expensive prototypes. Companies such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) been using VR for years to hold design and engineering reviews, prompted by the pandemic to find new alternatives to traditional clay models.

VR is saving the automotive industry millions in man hours and material, by reducing the number of prototypes built per vehicle line and opening up the design process to a global workforce.

JLR are using VR to hold engineering reviews earlier in the vehicle development process.

2. Healthcare
VR is making a significant impact in healthcare. In November 2021, the FDA approved prescription-use EaseVRx for the treatment of pain reduction in adults. The system uses cognitive behavioral therapy and other behavioral principles such as deep relaxation, attention-shifting, interoceptive awareness, and others, to aid in the reduction of chronic pain. VR has even been used as pain relief for burn injuries.

Healthcare professionals can use VR to better prepare themselves for being in the operating theater – whether as a junior doctor explaining diagnoses and treatment plans, or an orthopedic surgeon performing surgery. Companies like Osso VR enable surgeons to interact with medical devices in VR and practice surgery on virtual bodies, helping to increase familiarity with new devices and proficiency in implanting them. Moreover, companies like Altoida are trying to leverage XR and machine learning to develop digital biomarkers for neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer’s. This technology platform offers earlier diagnosis, facilitates clinical trial participation, and enables precise monitoring of disease progression and treatment responses.

VR can also be used as a treatment for mental health issues, with Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy thought to be particularly effective in the treatment of PTSD and anxiety. There are many other ways spending time in VR can have therapeutic benefits.

3. Retail
The way we shop online is set to drastically change with ‘the metaverse’. With VR retail experiences and body-scanning technology, we will be able to try on clothes in the virtual world to see what they’d look like in person. Not only is this a time-effective experience for shoppers, but it’s also more sustainable because customers will know before they order whether the item fits their shape and size, reducing the environmental cost of production and shipping fast fashion.

Various companies are attempting to bring us the VR shopping experience, including the European retailer ASOS, who invested in software development company Trillenium. Fashion houses like Tommy Hilfiger and DKNY were also amongst the brands that took part in the second annual Metaverse Fashion Week in March 2023.

Brands like Ralph Lauren and Gucci have also worked with VR Studio Emperia to make bespoke, virtual store environments for high end customers to browse their collection.

4. Tourism
The global pandemic and lockdowns accelerated a lot of developments in virtual travel, with many missing the freedom to travel to different countries, visit world-famous landmarks, and experience a glimpse into another culture.

Imagine being able to experience a guided tour of Barcelona or Budapest from your home in California or Singapore. With VR, you can do just that. You can even take a Harry Potter tour of Edinburgh from anywhere in the world!

In the post-Covid era, the developments in VR for tourism enable you to try a holiday before you buy it. Thomas Cook launched their ‘Try Before You Fly‘ VR experience all the way back in 2015, where potential holidaymakers could visit stores in various countries to experience the holiday in VR before booking it. As a result, there was a 190% uplift in New York excursions bookings after people tried the 5-minute version of the holiday in VR.

VR Expeditions 2.0 is another way tourism can become more accessible, with hundreds of virtual field trips available. From Rome’s Colosseum to coral reefs, and the surface of Mars, users can travel the world from the comfort of their own home.

5. Real estate
If you’d prefer to stay closer to home, you can look around properties from the comfort of your [existing] home – no estate agent appointments or sacrificing your weekend needed.

Companies like Matterport are leading the way for people to explore houses online and get a ‘feel’ for the space, saving time looking rounds places that might be smaller, darked, or otherwise not what you expected. This way, you can focus your time viewing only the properties you’re most likely to love in person.

Besides, some companies like Stucco are using VR for home staging. This doesn’t only save costs but also allows real state agents to use different interior design styles depending on the client’s preferences.

6. Architecture
VR is gradually changing the way that architects design and experiment with their work. VR makes it possible to see not just what a building or space will look like but how it will feel.

For example, if someone was looking to add an extension to their property, they can experience the space and what it will look like before it’s physically built and then make real-time changes. This saves the customer and architect time and money, as well as increasing satisfaction on completion of the project.

Architects have been using 3D models for years but using immersive tools allows them to understand and explore the space at the deepest level possible. The BBC even have a TV show in the UK, Your Home Made Perfect, built on two rival architects showcasing designs to homeowners in VR, before they’re built in reality.

7. Interior design
It’s not just the structure of your home that’s getting a makeover in VR. You can now use immersive experiences to mimic the interior design too. Companies like Flipspaces are capitalizing on this, providing users with 3D visualizations of the interior of their home or workspace – from lighting to ventilation, color schemes, and products themselves.

Platforms like this don’t just help designers and homeowners visualize the look and feel of a property- they also have the potential to drive direct sales for furniture companies like Ikea.


8. Gambling
Fancy yourself as a poker pro? You can play multiplayer poker in VR with Vegas Infinite, formerly Pokerstars VR. It’s just like being in a real casino where you can talk to other players and read their body language. You can plan poker, blackjack, roulette, and slots against real opponents and be in with the chance of winning money prizes.

9. Learning and development
The training industry has started to embrace the opportunities VR learning brings, with companies like Bank of America sourcing 10,000 headsets, and Walmart offering VR training to its 1mn employees.


With VR, people can learn through experience in a risk-free space; it’s consistent, affordable, and scales. VirtualSpeech, for example, provides VR training for soft skills such as public speaking, active listening, and sales. They blend e-learning with practice in VR and online simulations, enabling learners to build their confidence and skills in VR environments, from meeting rooms to auditoriums.

With the experiential learning VR brings, VR training significantly increases learning retention levels PwC infamously did a study on the effectiveness of VR learning for soft skills, and found people learnt up to 4 times faster in VR.

10. Recruitment
Lloyds Banking Group became the first organization in the UK to introduce VR exercises to assess graduates for its 2017 intake. In the future, VR could be used to assess key skills required for a job such as decision making, for job interviews, and could even replace assessment days altogether by bringing candidates together in the metaverse.

This would save both the employer and potential employee time and cost in the interview process, and even attract higher quality candidates, as Deutsche Bahn has found.

11. Entertainment
VR is being used in the entertainment industry to heighten experiences with 360 films (Examples on YouTube) and increase emotional connection with the characters or film itself. Disney Movies VR, for example, takes the user to red carpet events and to an interview with ‘The Jungle Book’ cast.

VR could also revolutionize the way that media content is made, as companies like Flipside XR have shown. Flipside provides real-time animation and motion capture, enabling creators to built interactive animated shows or live stream animated performances via VR or more traditional channels YouTube, Twitch or Facebook live.

12. Education
VR is revolutionizing education by enabling students to learn in an immersive, experiential way, from anywhere in the world. VR provides the opportunity to democratize education by opening up opportunities to students of all backgrounds, which may not have been possible before. For example, Victory XR has partnered with Engage to provide digital twin campuses to enable students to learn in live, interactive classes from the brightest minds in the world. Another example of VR in Education is the RTC Antwerpen project, the largest XR education initiative to date, which will equip 150K students across 690 schools with immersive learning opportunities.

Other companies like Tech Row enable students to go on a space mission to Pluto, explore Antarctica, and experience the wonders of Machu Picchu. Field trips to the Colosseum and Ancient Rome can be completed from the classroom, and you can even be taken on a journey of the human body as a white blood cell!

13. Sports
The way that we watch sports is already changing, with several VR companies specializing in watching live sports events. You can now watch the NBA, NFL, and other events in VR. BT Sport broadcasted the UEFA Champions League final in 360 degree VR via YouTube and the BT VR app, all for free. You could watch the game from several viewpoints in the stadium, as if you were actually there.

Companies such as Big Screen VR enable people to watch the Superbowl together in VR, and NBC announced it will live stream the opening and closing ceremonies of the Beijing Olympics in VR, as well as provide highlights for some of the events in VR. You can even host a ‘virtual Olympics watch party‘ if that’s your kind of thing.

This is a great way of opening up live sports events to people who can’t travel to the venue or can’t afford tickets to watch the sports in person. Instead, they can get a sense of atmosphere and presence from VR.

14. Art and design
With VR, you don’t just create life-size artwork – you can be in it. You can actually step into your image and come out the other side. The most well-known application for creating art in VR is Tiltbrush and it’s amazing what some people have managed to paint in it. You can also draw, sculpt, create and animate virtual 3D models and sculptures with Masterpiece Studio.

15. Events, conferences and meetings
Since VR enables individuals to meet in places virtually, it’s no surprise that the pandemic brought a rise in VR events, conferences, and meetings. Platforms such as  Remio VR, Rec Room, and Horizon Workrooms can be used to hold collaborative, interactive meetings with colleagues from anywhere in the world.

You can put on your headset in London, and meet virtually with your colleagues in New York and Madrid, and connect and work with them as if you were all in the same room. With collaboration tools such as whiteboards and freehand 3D drawings, they help remote or hybrid meetings become as good as face-to-face meetings, without the time and cost needed to travel.

Some people are using VR for networking and events. Educators in VR regularly host events in VR on topics including cyberbullying, storytelling, and language learning, which are available to attend in VR or desktop. By bringing people together in VR, attendees can immerse themselves in the topic and virtual space, and build stronger connections with each other compared to events via traditional video conferencing tools.

16. Fitness
When we first wrote this article in 2017, VR fitness wasn’t a thing – we originally had 21 industries using VR and fitness wasn’t one of them. Now, VR fitness apps are some of the most downloaded and used VR apps available, allowing you to upgrade and socialize your home workout.

Two of the most popular VR fitness apps are Supernatural and Fit XR. With FitXR, for example, you join an immersive fitness club with new classes added each day, including boxing, dance, and HIIT. You can even take part in the classes live with your friends to make your workout even more fun, and mimic the social interaction of traditional gym classes. Another use case of VR in fitness is wearing the headset while being on a static bike. Apps like Vzfit and Holofit allow you to bike through real locations or virtual worlds from the comfort of your own home.

17. Wellbeing
With the rise in popularity for wellness and meditation, it’s not surprising that, yes you guessed it, you can now meditate in VR too. TRIPP are paving the way for calmer minds in VR with over 40 meditations, breath visualization, and visual landscapes.

Available for VR, and coming soon for AR as well, they claim to be a ‘fitness solution for your inner self’, and what’s more calming then escaping reality and immersing yourself into a calmer physical space?

Wellbeing in VR
18. Social
VR enables people to meet in the same virtual space from anywhere in the world. Once in VR, or ‘the metaverse’, people can visit virtual cinemas, restaurants, beaches, concerts, and more together.

There are several big players already building social communities in the VR space, including Meta’s Horizon Worlds and AltspaceVR. Horizon Worlds not only enables people to explore virtual worlds together, but they can create immersive content too, including VR spaces specifically for their friends and colleagues.

19. Charity
One of the best things about the rise of VR is its ability to evoke empathy. This makes it extremely valuable to charities as it can be used to increase understanding of an issue by experiencing it either in the first person or as a bystander to specific situations.

People are more likely to be moved to action when they are immersed in a situation, they would otherwise not be able to relate to, or come close to experiencing. For example, in 2015, Unicef used the video ‘Clouds Over Sidra‘ to double their donations towards their work with the Syrian Refugee Crisis. Another example of this is the “A walk through dementia” VR experience. Created by Alzheimer Research UK, this experience walks users through the heartbreaking reality of what having Alzheimer’s is like.

20. Marketing
Marketing is becoming more and more about how companies make customers feel so utilizing the immersion of VR seems like a natural extension. From Topshop providing fashionistas with a front row at London Fashion Week with a VR headset, to Tom’s shoes taking customers on a trip through Peru to show where each pair of shoes they donate goes to, the heightened sense of connection through VR is sure to make you remember and connect with these brands.

VR marketing is also becoming popular for universities to create virtual campus tours of universities. Princeton, Yale, and Columbia have all tried this out as a way for more students to be able to see their campus.

21. Recreation
Many real-life hobbies are now available in VR, and the immersive, social experience makes them all the more enjoyable and accessible. If you’re a fan of cultural activities, you can visit museums such as the Natural History Museum in London or if you’re into sports, you can play golf or football in VR.

If you’re more of a thrill-seeker, you can head to Guizhou in China to VR Star Theme Park, where there are over 40 VR rides.

22. Law enforcement
As with the military, police forces are using AR and VR tools from companies like VirTra to train personnel in simulated scenarios complete with visual, auditory, and physical stimuli (ranging from barking dogs and street noise to the recoil of discharging a weapon).

The technologies even enable police forces to escalate or de-escalate trainees’ simulated interactions with individuals inside the virtual training environments, helping learners practice making judgment calls and critical decisions under stress.

A group of University of Alabama researchers had collaborated with law enforcement officials to measure brain waves during VR police training. One of the lead researchers said the work may “improve training of officers and positively affect the hiring process.”

23. News and journalism
You can now watch news stories and documentaries in VR. The New York Times has already entered this space, and it’s only a matter of time before other media outlets join them. In the NYT VR app, you can experience stories rather than just listen to them, as if you were standing opposite the journalist where the story is happening.

VR is likely to influence your workplace, hobbies and social life in the future – and that’s sooner than you may think. The possibilities of VR are endless; the only things we can’t replace in VR are eating and sleeping.</p>

            <h2>VR in Gaming</h2>
            <p>VR gaming has transformed the gaming industry by offering an immersive experience that puts players inside the game world. Popular VR games include Beat Saber, Half-Life: Alyx, and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim VR
                
What is virtual reality gaming (VR gaming)?
Virtual reality gaming is the application of a three-dimensional (3D) artificial environment to computer games. Virtual reality environments are created with VR software and presented to the user in such a way that they supersede the real-world environment, creating suspension of disbelief and helping the user experience the VR environment as real.

Users can play VR games on smartphones, PCs and laptops, and gaming consoles. VR gaming control may involve a standard keyboard and mouse, game controllers and motion capture methods. More complex VR rooms may include treadmill floors or similar methods to further the user's sense of freedom of movement and feelings of immersion within the virtual environment. In other VR gaming setups, the user may be confined to a limited area surrounding a computer but have free range of motion within the area.

As advancements were made in the technology, VR hardware for gaming has matured to the point that VR headsets offer gaming experiences with little lag or nausea, two areas that had presented problems historically. Some experts believe that people can build a tolerance to VR induced nausea as well.

Some VR headsets on the market are the following:

HP Reverb
Meta Quest
Microsoft Hololens
Samsung Gear VR
Sony PlayStation
Valve Index
Most of these companies offer motion controllers and a tracker to work in concert with the headset. In addition to entertainment, VR games can be used for various types of training and for virtual reality therapy.

VR gaming is distinct from augmented reality gaming (AR gaming), which involves the integration of digital content with the user's real-world environment.


How does VR gaming work?
VR gaming systems are composed of a game and hardware. The games are designed to create an immersive experience that gives users the feeling that they are interacting with a world outside their physical bodies. These systems are designed to have as little latency as possible to give fast and accurate feedback to users based on their actions.

VR gaming systems generate realistic sensations that simulate users' physical presence in a computer-generated environment. The goal of VR gaming systems is to let users believe they inhabit a virtual world. People using VR gaming systems move around the virtual world and interact with virtual features and items.

At its simplest, a VR game is a 3D image that can be explored interactively on a computing device by manipulating keys, mouse or touchscreen. More commonly, virtual reality uses a head-mounted display with a screen that wraps around the eyes. These systems also use specially designed rooms with multiple projectors and large screens.

VR rooms may be enhanced with wearable technology and sensory components, such as scents and Haptic devices for tactile feedback.

Types of VR gaming accessories and hardware
The headsets and controllers that make up VR gaming systems are often sold together.

Photo of people using VR gaming headsetsWESTEND61/GETTY IMAGES
Today's VR headset technology has eliminated issues with lag and nausea.
Headsets
Virtual reality headsets are used to immerse the user in a game or work setting. Some headsets can capture head and eye movements and transmit them to the game. Others include stereo sound systems to project the game's audio content. Some come just as goggles that display the virtual game world to the user. VR headsets do not let users see any of the real external world around them. Some headsets also come with built-in microphones.

Controllers
These hand-based controllers let users interact with the virtual world. Users can select objects, drag and drop objects, point, outline boundaries and scroll up or down with a VR controller. Some controllers have motion detectors that can sense a user's hand motion, like throwing, for example. The controller recreates these actions in the game.

VR gloves take VR controllers a step further by detecting micromovements in the user's hands and fingers and transmitting those to the game. This adds small motor skills to VR video games and enables users to grasp, pick up and carry small items in a game. Some gloves contain haptic technology that let users feel the virtual world of the game. The gloves create vibrations on the fingertips to simulate the presence of an object. Some also contain tiny actuators that displace the user's skin and apply significant resistive force.

Some other auxiliary VR gaming accessories are the following:

steering wheels and accelerator controllers for racing games;
treadmills that sense running distance and speed;
full-body haptic suits;
gun stocks that simulate a real gun in a virtual environment;
table tennis paddle grips;
haptic foot controllers and shoes;
base stations that locate and track wireless VR objects and incorporate them into a game;
cloth covers for increased headset comfort; and
portable battery packs to power more complex VR technology.
What to consider when buying VR gaming equipment
There are a number of factors to consider when buying VR gaming equipment:

Budget. VR equipment ranges in price with many options costing hundreds of dollars.
Platform. The options available are standalone systems that don't require an external system or PC-, smartphone- or console-based VR systems. Current smartphone VR sets are less immersive than PC or console ones.
Compatibility. If using a PC-based VR system, users must make sure the computer meets gaming system's qualifications in areas such as graphics cards and processing power.
Resolution. It's important to have a high-resolution headset to have a realistic VR experience. Resolution per eye is the metric used to measure headset resolution. It denotes the number of pixels the headset can display.
Field of view. This metric describes how much of the virtual environment is visible to the viewer at any one time. A higher field of view creates a more immersive experience.
Refresh rate. This is measured in frames per second (FPS) and dictates the smoothness of an image. A low FPS rate can cause motion sickness.
Tracking. Positional tracking aligns a user's physical movement with in-game movement. Virtual reality systems that provide one-to-one positional tracking avoid in-game delays.
Physical space. VR gaming usually requires the user to move around in physical space to act out actions in the virtual world. Users must ensure they have a suitable space to play virtual games so as not to injure themselves.
Physical conditions. Although technology is improving, VR systems have the potential to induce nausea. Some also warn people with epilepsy against using them.
History of VR gaming
VR gaming was a logical extension of video games and 3D games. Prior to the development of compact VR technology, VR gaming used projector rooms with multiple screens and projectors.

Significant VR gaming milestones include the following:

1962. Cinematographer Morton Heilig created what is often recognized as the first virtual reality machine. Sensorama was a booth that multiple people could sit in for a fully immersed movie experience. It included audio, 3D video, vibrations and smell. Heilig was granted the patent for it in 1962.
1965. Computer scientist Ivan Sutherland described his vision of the Ultimate Display in a paper. It was a room in which a computer controlled the existence of matter, using interactive graphics and force-feedback controller capabilities.
1968. Sutherland created a head-mounted device, called the Sword of Damocles, that presented 3D models to the wearer. The models changed their perspective when the user moved their head.
1984. Computer scientist Jaron Lanier popularized the term virtual reality in the 1980s and described how VR could make television and video games more engaging. Lanier founded VPL in 1984, which became the first company to sell virtual reality technology. VPL's DataGlove let people move and reorient virtual objects.
1989. The DataGlove inspired engineers at Mattel and Nintendo to create a consumer-grade version at a much lower price. Power Glove for the Nintendo Entertainment System came out in 1989, along with two games designed for the VR device: Super Glove Ball and Bad Street Brawler.
1995. Nintendo released the Virtual Boy gaming console, which used a VR headset to display stereoscopic 3D graphics. However, the technology was considered a commercial failure because of the complexity and cost of creating consumer-grade VR gaming industry products.
2010. Palmer Luckey developed the prototype of the Oculus Rift headset, which was released as a commercial product in 2016. Oculus Rift was marketed to gamers as an inexpensive option for VR video games and led to the development of PlayStation VR and the HTC Vive later that year.
2019. Oculus Quest, a division of Facebook -- now called Meta -- developed the Oculus Quest headset. Facebook also invested in Reality Labs and its work developing the metaverse.
2021. The concept of the metaverse became popular as Meta developed ways for users to socialize and play games in its metaverse. Interest in the metaverse started driving investment in VR technology for corporate use.
Graphic showing how augmented reality and virtual reality differThe key way that augmented reality and virtual reality differ
Virtual reality vs. augmented reality vs. mixed reality
Virtual reality and augmented reality have some significant overlap, but there are key differences between the two concepts. Like virtual reality, augmented reality can be used in gaming and a variety of other contexts.


Virtual reality creates a completely simulated environment that a user perceives as approximating reality through their senses. The user suspends belief and accepts that the VR is real. The entire environment is simulated.

By contrast, AR integrates virtual elements into a real environment. The user is not transported to another place. Instead, digital technology augments or changes the place they are in.

A simple example of augmented reality would be a game of virtual checkers projected on a table surface. One real-world example of augmented reality gaming is the mobile application Pokemon Go. The game uses a smartphone's gyroscope, camera, clock and GPS to create a location-based AR environment. Users point their smartphone camera at the current environment, where a virtual Pokemon is superimposed on the picture of the real environment.

Chart comparing augmented reality, virtual reality and mixed realityThree different simulation types are used in gaming and business.
Mixed reality is similar to augmented reality but further blends the digital and physical worlds so that there is more digital content than with augmented reality. Mixed reality is sometimes referred to as hybrid reality.

            <h2>VR in Education</h2>
            <p>VR in education enhances learning by providing immersive experiences that are not possible in a traditional classroom. It allows students to explore historical sites, understand complex subjects, or even conduct virtual science experiments.
                Virtual reality, or VR, is taking off in education with an increasing number of schools adopting the technology.

VR allows students to experience destinations from across the world without ever having to leave the classroom. Imagine students being able to explore the pyramids of giza whilst sat at their desks. This is what virtual reality education allows.

What is virtual reality learning?
Virtual reality, or VR, is taking off in education with an increasing number of schools adopting the technology.

VR allows students to experience destinations from across the world without ever having to leave the classroom. Imagine students being able to explore the pyramids of giza whilst sat at their desks. This is what virtual reality education allows.


VR in the classroom
Most people have heard of virtual reality (VR) but many people do not know what it is or how it is used in learning and education.

VR refers to interactive content (images or videos) which enables the viewer to explore the entire 360 degrees of a scene.

Take a look at a short VR video of Roche Abbey in Yorkshire, below. You can click or drag across the video to view the entire scene.


VR video of Roche Abbey filmed by Immersion VR
How does it work?
A type of VR known as 360VR is most commonly used in education. With this type of VR, real-world locations are captured with specialist cameras and equipment. The footage is then taken back to the studio where it is produced into VR content.


Specialist camera being used by Immersion VR
The VR content can then be viewed on VR headsets or projected onto walls in what are known as immersive classrooms.

360VR can be used in education to teach pupils about the world around them. What’s more, virtual reality has a unique ability to inspire and engage students.

Students can experience locations that would not be possible or too expensive to visit in person. In this way, VR can open a whole new world of possibilities to teachers and schools.

How can virtual reality improve education?
Virtual reality can improve education by providing students with memorable and immersive experiences that would otherwise not be possible. What’s more, it can all take place within the classroom.

VR is accessible to every student and can be easily monitored by teachers. Virtual experiences have the power to engage and inspire students in a unique and powerful way.


Given the growth of VR within education, and the positive response from schools, we wouldn’t be surprised if VR made it onto the curriculum at some point in the future. Curriculum aligned content and structured VR lesson plans have already been developed and are available in the UK.

How can virtual reality help students?
There are so many ways in which virtual reality can help students but the main points are below:

1. Students learn better through experience
VR provides students an opportunity to learn through experience, in contrast to the traditional methods of reading and writing.

2. VR has the ability to inspire
Being able to see and experience extraordinary locations within the classroom is completely unique to VR and it is inspirational to students.

3. VR sparks the imagination and encourages creative thinking
The immersive experience that VR provides is unparalleled in teaching. Students are “transported” out of the classroom and their imagination is allowed to flourish.

4. VR in education promotes peer interaction
Throughout the VR experience, students are encouraged to interact with each other. Afterwards, they are eager to share their thoughts and discuss their experiences.

5. VR engages students
Many students get bored with classic teaching methods. The modern technology of VR gets students’ attention like nothing else. We find that students instantly want to try out the VR.

6. VR provides realistic travel experiences
Using VR, schools can provide students with travel experiences that would not be possible or practical. Schools can save time and money whilst providing students with incredible experiences.

7. VR in the classroom is inclusive
With VR, every student gets the same opportunity to enjoy the experience. Unlike traditional school trips that can be too expensive for parents or too impractical for their children, VR is for all students.

8. VR offers memorable educational experiences
Long after the VR has finished, students remember the experience and they are eager to reflect on it in future lessons.

Implementing VR in the classroom
There are two main ways in which VR is implemented in the classroom: VR headsets, and immersive classrooms.

What is an immersive classroom?
One of the most common and effective ways of utilising VR in education is via virtual reality classrooms, or immersive classrooms.

An immersive classroom is a teaching room in which images are projected onto the internal walls of the room. This creates a virtual environment within the classroom.


An Immersive Classroom
Students can be “transported” to a different place, without having to leave the classroom. Without the need for VR headsets, students can enjoy the experience together, and are encouraged to interact with each other.

Unlike VR headsets which some students can find difficult or uncomfortable to use, immersive classrooms are suitable for all students. The pupils are able to enjoy the VR content in a more familiar environment.

VR headsets in the classroom
VR headsets are a common, practical way of implementing VR in the classroom. With minimal cost, equipment, and space needed, an increasing number of schools are turning to VR headsets.

For a classroom of 30 students, typically up to 15 headsets are required. These are usually standalone headsets, which means they don’t have to be connected to any other device, such as a computer.

Teachers are taught how to use the headsets before implementing them into a lesson.

The main benefit of VR headsets is the level of immersion they provide. Although they can be a little more tricky to use than immersive classrooms, they provide an incredibly realistic experience. An experience that students aren’t likely to forget in a hurry.

VR in primary schools
VR can be effectively used in primary education, and is becoming increasingly common in the UK.

Immersive classrooms tend to be more popular than VR headsets amongst primary schools. This is because every student can be easily monitored, and young students do not need to be shown how to use headsets. This ensures that the experience is smoother and equal for all the students.

Pupils are asked to look around and talk about what they see. This provides opportunities for students to collaborate and can particularly improve interaction amongst more introverted students.

Reducing social barriers at a young age is extremely important and is one of the reasons many primary schools are turning to VR.

Virtual reality in secondary education
Within secondary education, VR headsets tend to be more popular than immersive classrooms. This is because the impact on older students tends to be greater with the headsets.


With the entire field of view enclosed, the sense of immersion with a VR headset is unparalleled. Also, unlike with primary school pupils, secondary students are better able to use the headsets, requiring less input and guidance from the teacher.

By utilising VR headsets, teachers are able to provide secondary students with a feeling of actually “being there” – this is what we mean when we talk about immersion. For many students this is an incredible experience, and it is something that really has to be tried before it can be judged.</p>

            <h2>VR in Healthcare</h2>
            <p>In healthcare, VR is used for simulation training, therapeutic purposes, and patient rehabilitation, offering innovative ways to treat and manage various health conditionsScienceSoft Global Menu iconBack to the main menu

Virtual Reality solutions allow both healthcare professionals and patients interact with simulated environments tailored for medical education (including simulative surgery training), pain management or rehabilitation. In 2022, the global healthcare VR market was estimated $628 million. It is projected to grow at an average CAGR of 38.7% and reach $6.2 billion by 2029.

VR Adoption in Healthcare:
According to the Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research, healthcare is among the top 3 industries that will remain leading adopters of VR technology up to 2025.

82% of healthcare professionals agree that virtual reality creates a convenient way of accessing and learning information for medical students and practicing healthcare professionals, Accenture says. The agency also reports that 62% of patients would welcome virtual reality healthcare services as an alternative to traditional healthcare.

The key drivers of the growing VR adoption in healthcare are:

Extreme demand for quality healthcare services.
Need to reduce healthcare costs.
Increased role of connected devices in the healthcare sector.
VR Software Architecture
The architecture of VR applications in healthcare depends on their use in the industry. However, the general architecture always includes 3 main components: a client VR application (with a VR visualization module), a database (with 3D models, scenarios, and users), and a web administration panel that grants access to and control of both the app and the database.

Thypical architecture of VR applications in healthcare- ScienceSoft

Application of VR in Healthcare:

Virtual reality makes for more effective theoretical learning of medical students and starting-out healthcare professionals. With VR, learners can inspect 3D medical models in the details, which can’t be reproduced in physical models, or learn to communicate with AI-controlled virtual patients, whose attitude and behavior can be easily altered for different learning purposes (e.g., communication with patients who are non-native English speakers).

How VR for medical education works: Any virtual learning session can be held in groups or individually and guided either by a real tutor, who is also connected to the VR app or by a virtual preprogrammed tutor controlled by the AI algorithms.

Use cases:
                
Anatomy learning.
Medical social skills learning.

VR for  Medical learning:

VR software that focuses specifically on practical medical training helps medical school graduates and healthcare professionals alike acquire hands-on skills in risk-free conditions. This type of healthcare VR allows simulating scenarios that are difficult, dangerous, or expensive to recreate in real life.

How VR for medical training works: Upon entering a VR app’s simulated environment, a user becomes a part of a training scenario that expects them to complete predetermined steps in, for instance, performing a medical procedure or handling medical equipment. A separate analytical module continuously records the taken actions and assesses a medical professional’s performance based on set criteria.

Use cases:

Medical procedure simulation.
Emergency case simulation.
Medical equipment use training.

VR for suegery:

By allowing surgeons to perform different types of mock-surgeries in the virtual space, VR helps eliminate practical skill deficiency faster. Surgeons can become skilled professionals without using expensive onetime use mannequins for training.

How VR for surgery works: With the help of haptic controllers, a surgeon performs a virtual surgery in a virtual operating room. From start to finish, software guides a user through the necessary steps, letting them remember the right sequence of actions. The VR app can also be used for explaining the surgery process to patients.

Use cases:

Surgical training.
Pre-surgical planning.
Medical device marketing.

Virtual reality pain management apps help lower the level of pain or extreme discomfort by effectively diverting a patient’s attention. This type of VR helps minimize the use of potentially harming painkillers and reduce healthcare costs.

How VR for pain management works: After being immersed in the VR simulation, a patient can either become a part of an interactive gamified experience or transferred to a highly realistic environment with a soothing atmosphere that, together with audio stimulation, helps put their mind at ease.

Use cases:

Chronic pains.
Acute pains.
Medical procedure pain.
Mental pain and anxiety.

VR for Rehabilitation

VR for Rehabilitation

By moving rehabilitation exercises into the virtual realm, VR turns patients’ therapy sessions into a gamified experience that motivates users to strive for better results via virtual goals and achievements. Software’s built-in AI can provide detailed guidance and inspiring support instead of a real therapist, allowing for cheaper and timewise flexible individual rehabilitation.

How VR for rehabilitation works: The VR app guides a patient through their personal training program stored in the software database. A therapist can edit the program anytime as well as control the results – either via the app’s analytics module or by virtually joining the VR session as an instructor.

Use cases:

Neurological rehabilitation.
Physical therapy.
Cognitive rehabilitation.

VR for Physical Therapy

Virtual physical therapy can offer patients a wide range of exercises – from general orthopedics to injury-recovery. The exercises can be created for specific age-groups too, thus helping children to develop motor skills and older patients – to preserve their agility. Special sessions can also be created for people, who are learning to use a cane or a prosthetic limb.

How VR for physical therapy works: All exercises can be supervised by either an AI-based virtual instructor or a real instructor, who joins the VR sessions remotely. A comprehensive analytics system continuously monitors a patient’s condition and ensures that the exercises do not harm a patient's health in any way.

Use cases:

Sports injuries.
Child care/Geriatrics.
Adaptation to assistive devices or prosthetics.

VR for Stroke Rehabilitation

VR for Stroke Rehabilitation

To effectively recover after stroke, patients re-learn to perform their typical daily actions in the virtual environment. Patients can access a rich database of exercises that help them restore motor skills or improve spatial orientation abilities without posing any risks of damage to self, others or the objects they manipulate. The rehabilitation can be remote, thus allowing to significantly minimize the costs of treatment and transportation.

How VR for stroke rehabilitation works: While post-stroke patients perform repetitive exercises in the VR world, the integrated machine-learning algorithms continuously monitor their performance and automatically adjust the difficulty to ensure progress. Therapists can access the admin panel to check how far their patients progressed or what exercises they got stuck on.

Use cases:

Physical function restoration.
Cognitive abilities improvement.</p>
