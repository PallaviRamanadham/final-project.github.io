            <h2>Introduction to VR</h2>
            <p>Virtual Reality (VR) is a simulated experience that can be similar to or completely different from the real world. It involves a user interacting with a computer-generated environment through various devices such as headsets, gloves, and body suits.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="page2">
            <h2>History of VR</h2>
            <p>The concept of VR has been around since the 1950s, but it wasn't until the late 20th century that technology caught up with imagination, leading to the development of VR as we know it today. Milestones include the creation of the first head-mounted display (HMD) and the rise of consumer VR platforms.</p>

        <section id="page3">
            <h2>How VR Works</h2>
            <p>VR works by tracking the user's motions and adjusting the virtual environment accordingly in real-time. This immersive experience is achieved through the use of VR headsets that display 3D images, along with sensors and external cameras for motion tracking.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="page4">
            <h2>Types of VR Systems</h2>
            <p>There are mainly two types of VR systems: tethered and standalone. Tethered systems require a connection to a powerful computer, while standalone systems are self-contained and offer more freedom of movement.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="page5">
            <h2>Applications of VR</h2>
            <p>VR has a wide range of applications including gaming, education, healthcare, military training, and virtual meetings. Its ability to create immersive, interactive environments makes it a powerful tool for learning, entertainment, and communication.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="page6">
            <h2>VR in Gaming</h2>
            <p>VR gaming has transformed the gaming industry by offering an immersive experience that puts players inside the game world. Popular VR games include Beat Saber, Half-Life: Alyx, and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim VR.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="page7">
            <h2>VR in Education</h2>
            <p>VR in education enhances learning by providing immersive experiences that are not possible in a traditional classroom. It allows students to explore historical sites, understand complex subjects, or even conduct virtual science experiments.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="page8">
            <h2>VR in Healthcare</h2>
            <p>In healthcare, VR is used for simulation training, therapeutic purposes, and patient rehabilitation, offering innovative ways to treat and manage various health conditions.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="page9">
            <h2>Future of VR</h2>
            <p>The 
future of VR is promising, with advancements in technology continuously enhancing the immersion and realism of virtual environments. We can expect VR to become more integrated into daily life, offering new ways to connect, learn, and entertain. Emerging technologies, such as improved haptic feedback and augmented reality (AR) integration, are set to further blur the lines between the physical and digital worlds, creating experiences that are currently unimaginable.

As VR becomes more accessible and user-friendly, its applications will expand beyond current sectors into areas like remote work, social interaction, and even space exploration, providing tools for collaboration and experimentation that leverage the best of both virtual and real-world capabilities.
